# THOR-Trigger
Small library that wraps control of MCP4725 DAC over FT232H

For basic usage example, check `client.py`.

## What do I need?
The only things you need:

- install `adafruit-circuitpython-mcp4725` and its dependencies via `pip` or similar
- `lib.py`

Everything else is just an artifact of `git` or `uv`. Happy coding!
